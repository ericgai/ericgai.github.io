I am always excited to get messages from people (as long as they are not trying to get me to buy something from them), so feel free to send me something, especially if I could be of any help, whether it's science, travel tips, or anything in between.  
You can reach me at  
[ericgai@mit.edu](mailto:ericgai@mit.edu) (preferred for academic matters)  
or  
[gaieric@icloud.com](mailto:gaieric@icloud.com)  
  
If I don't already know you, send an invitation with a note and I will be happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-gai-55638688/).
