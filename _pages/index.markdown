Hello! My name is Eric Gai. I am a first-year graduate student in the [Computational and Systems Biology (CSB) program](https://csbphd.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  

Prior to MIT, I completed my undergraduate degree at the College of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with [Prof. Jay Groves](http://groveslab.cchem.berkeley.edu/). I have also been involved with work in [Chris Rowley's group at Carleton University](https://www.rowleygroup.net/), [Abalone Bio](https://www.abalonebio.com/), [Tejal Desai's group at UCSF](https://pharm.ucsf.edu/desai), and [Yingjie Wu's group at Dalian Medical Univeristy](https://igeam.dmu.edu.cn/index.htm). I spent a gap term working for Air Canada as a [Station Attendant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lY6XgF_Z78g) at Vancouver International Airport before starting graduate school.  

I am also an avid traveller, and I have been an aviation enthusiast since I was six years old. You can see a map of everywhere I've flown [here](https://my.flightradar24.com/dodohuipy9). I post about my experiences in the Travel section.
