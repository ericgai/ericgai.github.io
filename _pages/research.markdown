## T Cell Signaling Kinetics on Reconstituted Membranes  
*With Dr. Summer (Simou) Sun and Dr. Jay T. Groves*  
T cells are a class of immune cells that are central to adaptive immunity. They are impressively sensitive and specific: they can be activated by antigen MHC complexes at single-molecule densities, and yet are able to distinguish between antigen peptides with single amino acid differences. To study the physical mechanisms that allow for these qualities, we reconstitute membrane-proximal signaling proteins on supported lipid bilayers and observe their behaviour under total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. We focused on the kinase ZAP-70, which is activated downstream of the T Cell Receptor. We determined that the phoshporylation state of ZAP-70 tunes both its potency as a kinase as well as its delay time to activation upon recruitment to the membrane. We also discovered a nonequilibrium process for the membrane engagement of ZAP-70, evidenced by a gamma-like dwell time distribution. We believe that these qualities are important ways through which kinetic proofreading and positive feedback are mediated in the T Cell signaling pathway.
